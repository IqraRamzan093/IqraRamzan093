- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on multiple tasks of Python related to AI. I have experience with a variety of AI libraries and frameworks, including TensorFlow, and scikit-learn. I am interested in working on projects in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, deep learning, and machine learning.
